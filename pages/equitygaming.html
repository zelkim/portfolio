<b>What is "roleplaying", and, GTA: San Andreas???</b>
</p>
<p>
    Roleplaying in this context is simulating real life.
    <br/><br/>
    In the game, upon registration, you would start off as a blank slate. And the more you play, the more you interact with other people, the more you interact with the environment, the more your character develops. Everything you do in the game will be consequential to what your character becomes.
    <br/><br/>
    In the game, you can take on different roles. You can become a policeman, a soldier, a medic, a newscaster, an investigative agent, anything. You can take roles from as little to small time crime member, or as big as a mafia boss.
    <br/><br/>
    Equity Gaming makes you experience things you wouldn't be able to experience in real life, in the game, through your own actions, making it an immersive experience.

    I have written an incomplete story that is based off of what happens in the game. Everything (except for the excessive romance) in the story actually happened (in the game). You can find the first two chapters to it <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/287869900-reticent">here</a>.

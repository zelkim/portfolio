<h1>
    ArcherAPI: Data of dlsu, for dlsu.
</h1>
<p><b>What data does this provide?</b></p>
<p>Right now, the API provides the data of all classes in DLSU. (Limited to: Term 3, A.Y. 2023-2024)</p>
<br/>
<p>However, I have planned for it in the future to support data on professors, more description on rooms, buildings, and other things.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>How was this achieved?</b></p>
<p>
    I scraped the list of all valid course codes in DLSU through the pre-enlistment facility, searching each
    course code from A-Z. After, I fed all those courses into the MLS through web scraping, saving the class schedules available of the term.
</p>
<p>
    <br/>
    <b>I found out the following information about Term 3, A.Y. 2023-2024:</b>
    <li>4100~ total classes active</li>
    <li>12,822 total courses all time in DLSU (including old/deprecated courses)</li>
    <li>1,200~ total courses with classes active in term 3.</li>
</p>
<br/>
<p>Example of class data when accessed through the API:</p>
<div class="code-box">
    {
        "id": "2150",
        "class": "COBLAW2",
        "section": "K31",
        "type": "HYBRID",
        "max_slots": "45",
        "current_slots": "40",
        "schedules": [
          {
            "days": "T",
            "time": "1615 - 1745",
            "room": " ",
            "prof": "SALUD, JAN RAPHAEL  RIVERA"
          },
          {
            "days": "F",
            "time": "1615 - 1745",
            "room": "",
            "prof": "SALUD, JAN RAPHAEL  RIVERA"
          }
        ]
      }
    
</div>

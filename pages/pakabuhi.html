<p>
    Pakabuhi.ph is a startup project me and my team started in 2021 after winning the
    Catbalogan City Hackathon 2020.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    Pakabuhi.ph is a mobile application that connected individual service providers that do laundry, haircuts, plumbing, cleaning, etc. to consumers via mobile application.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    The startup was incubated by Samar State University's Technology Business Incubator, which led to the  connection with the Provincial Government, Local PESO Office, DOST, and TESDA to obtain a list of potential individual service providers. 
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    However, the startup fell out due to funding issues, and time constraints due to senior high school.
